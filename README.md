# CurveCP in Go

A Go [CurveCP](http://curvecp.org/) implementation I was hacking on last year.  Another is [David Aderson's](https://code.google.com/p/curvecp/).

Interest waned when it became clear djb was unlikely to return to this alpha project soon (read: years/never), while working on other crypto primitives.  Nonetheless, I recommend reading the CurveCP protocol as an elegant and beautiful brick in the Computer Science canon. It is quite straighforward, yet neatly cleaves long-painful issues of security, while improving latency (not to mention mobility). It will inform many protocols to come, one of the first being [QUIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC).
